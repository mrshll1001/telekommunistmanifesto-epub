# telekommunistmanifesto-epub
My transcription of Dmytri Kleiner's [Telekommunist Manifesto](http://media.telekommunisten.net/manifesto.pdf), for use on e-readers. The PDF copy didn't automatically convert well at all. This is an on-going transcription, where details will be added as time goes on.

Released under the Peer-Production License. Please raise any issues, and feel free to contribute to the effort.

## Current Status
Did an initial transcription of the main body of text, as this is *mainly for personal use*. Uploaded a txt formatted version of the license.

## TODO

+ Include the preamble for the epub, including copyright notices
+ Add Notes and references sections
+ Add reference hyperlinks into the main body of text
+ Typos and formatting errors
+ Add a proper title page
